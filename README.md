# R-Project---Tokyo-Real-Estate-Market
Thank you very much for checking on this small university project !
A project from my university - I made a Shinyapp using R to analyze Tokyo real estate market.

You can check it out here - https://belkinmix.shinyapps.io/Tokyo/ 

To run it: 

1)Simply download all the files and put then in a single folder on your desktop or where most convenient for you.

2)Make sure to have these libraries installed: tidyverse, shiny, shinydashboard, DT, plotly, sf, leaflet, tmap

3)I used R to write the code - on RStudio
